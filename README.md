# GIT is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.

# GITHUB is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.

# Repository is just a file location where you are storing all the files related to your project.

# Clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository.

# Commit is an individual change to a file(s). Similiar to when you saving a file, except with Git, every save creates a unique ID that allows extensive record keeping of all the changes that were made when and by who

# Push refers to the act of sending your committed changes to a remote repository, such as a repository hosted on GitHub.

# Pull is a Git command used to update the local version of a repository from a remote. By default, this command does a set of things which includes: Updating the current local working branch and updating the remote tracking branches for all other branches.
 
# Branch is essentially is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch: the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, and is called master.

# Merge takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.

# Merge Conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. When all the changes in the code occur on different lines or in different files, Git will successfully merge commits without your help.

# Fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on. When downloading content from a remote repo, git pull and git fetch commands are available to accomplish the task.

# Remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server. In contrast to a local repository, a remote typically does not provide a file tree of the project's current state.
